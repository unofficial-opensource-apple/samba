<title>General Information</title>

<title>Where can I get it?</title>
<para>
The Samba suite is available at the <ulink url="http://samba.org/">samba website</ulink>.

<title>What do the version numbers mean?</title>
<para>
It is not recommended that you run a version of Samba with the word
"alpha" in its name unless you know what you are doing and are willing
to do some debugging. Many, many people just get the latest
recommended stable release version and are happy. If you are brave, by
all means take the plunge and help with the testing and development -
but don't install it on your departmental server. Samba is typically
very stable and safe, and this is mostly due to the policy of many
public releases.
</para>

<para>
How the scheme works:
<simplelist>
<member>When major changes are made the version number is increased. For
example, the transition from 1.9.15 to 1.9.16. However, this version
number will not appear immediately and people should continue to use
1.9.15 for production systems (see next point.)</member>

<member>Just after major changes are made the software is considered
unstable, and a series of alpha releases are distributed, for example
1.9.16alpha1. These are for testing by those who know what they are
doing.  The "alpha" in the filename will hopefully scare off those who
are just looking for the latest version to install.</member>

<member>When Andrew thinks that the alphas have stabilised to the point
where he would recommend new users install it, he renames it to the
same version number without the alpha, for example 1.9.16.</member>

<member>Inevitably bugs are found in the "stable" releases and minor patch
levels are released which give us the pXX series, for example 1.9.16p2.</member>
</simplelist>
</para>

<para>
So the progression goes:

<programlisting>
1.9.15p7	(production)
1.9.15p8	(production)
1.9.16alpha1	(test sites only)
:
1.9.16alpha20	(test sites only)
1.9.16		(production)
1.9.16p1	(production)
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The above system means that whenever someone looks at the samba ftp
site they will be able to grab the highest numbered release without an
alpha in the name and be sure of getting the current recommended
version.
</para>

<title>What platforms are supported?</title>
<para>
Many different platforms have run Samba successfully. The platforms
most widely used and thus best tested are Linux and SunOS.</para>

At time of writing, there is support (or has been support for in earlier 
versions):

<title>Pizza supply details</title>
<para>
Those who have registered in the Samba survey as "Pizza Factory" will
already know this, but the rest may need some help. Andrew doesn't ask
for payment, but he does appreciate it when people give him
pizza. This calls for a little organisation when the pizza donor is
twenty thousand kilometres away, but it has been done.
</para>

<para>
Method 1: Ring up your local branch of an international pizza chain
and see if they honour their vouchers internationally. Pizza Hut do,
which is how the entire Canberra Linux Users Group got to eat pizza
one night, courtesy of someone in the US.
</para>

<para>
Method 2: Ring up a local pizza shop in Canberra and quote a credit
card number for a certain amount, and tell them that Andrew will be
collecting it (don't forget to tell him.) One kind soul from Germany
did this.
</para>

<para>
Method 3: Purchase a pizza voucher from your local pizza shop that has
no international affiliations and send it to Andrew. It is completely
useless but he can hang it on the wall next to the one he already has
from Germany :-)
</para>

<para>
Method 4: Air freight him a pizza with your favourite regional
flavours. It will probably get stuck in customs or torn apart by
hungry sniffer dogs but it will have been a noble gesture.
