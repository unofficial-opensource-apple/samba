<B

the program always prompts for the password if the server is a Samba server.
It also ignores the "-N" argument when querying some (but not all) of our
NT servers."</SPAN

><P
>No, it does not ignore -N, it is just that your server rejected the 
null password in the connection, so smbclient prompts for a password
to try again.</P

CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbclient -L host -U%</B

>This will set both the username and password to null, which is
an anonymous login for SMB. Using -N would only set the password
to null, and this is not accepted as an anonymous login for most
SMB servers.</P

cdroms and do cr/lf translation. This is a very bad idea when use with
Samba. It causes all sorts of stuff ups.</P

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"We are unable to keep individual users from mapping to any other user's
home directory once they have supplied a valid password! They only need
to enter their own password. I have not found *any* method that I can
use to configure samba to enforce that only a user may map their own
home directory."</SPAN

><SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"User xyzzy can map his home directory. Once mapped user xyzzy can also map
*anyone* elses home directory!"</SPAN
></P
><P
>This is not a security flaw, it is by design. Samba allows
users to have *exactly* the same access to the UNIX filesystem
as they would if they were logged onto the UNIX box, except
that it only allows such views onto the file system as are
allowed by the defined shares.</P
><P
>This means that if your UNIX home directories are set up
such that one user can happily cd into another users
directory and do an ls, the UNIX security solution is to 
change the UNIX file permissions on the users home directories
such that the cd and ls would be denied.</P
><P
>Samba tries very hard not to second guess the UNIX administrators
security policies, and trusts the UNIX admin to set
the policies and permissions he or she desires.</P
><P
>Samba does allow the setup you require when you have set the
"only user = yes" option on the share, is that you have not set the
valid users list for the share.</P
><P
>Note that only user works in conjunction with the users= list,
so to get the behavior you require, add the line :
<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>users = %S</PRE
>
this is equivalent to:
<PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>valid users = %S</PRE
>
to the definition of the [homes] share, as recommended in
the smb.conf man page.</P
