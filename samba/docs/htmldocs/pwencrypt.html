	the wire, instead of plain text passwords. The newest clients 
	will only send encrypted passwords and refuse to send plain text 
	passwords, unless their registry is tweaked.</P
><P
>These passwords can't be converted to unix style encrypted 
	passwords. Because of that you can't use the standard unix 
	user database, and you have to store the Lanman and NT hashes 
	somewhere else. For more information, see the documentation

>The unix and SMB password encryption techniques seem similar 
	on the surface. This similarity is, however, only skin deep. The unix 
	scheme typically sends clear text passwords over the network when 
	logging in. This is bad. The SMB encryption scheme never sends the 
	cleartext password over the network but it does store the 16 byte 
	hashed values on disk. This is also bad. Why? Because the 16 byte hashed 
	values are a "password equivalent". You cannot derive the user's 
	password from them, but they could potentially be used in a modified 
	client to gain access to a server. This would require considerable 
	technical knowledge on behalf of the attacker but is perfectly possible. 
	You should thus treat the smbpasswd file as though it contained the 
	cleartext passwords of all your users. Its contents must be kept 
	secret, and the file should be protected accordingly.</P
><P
>Ideally we would like a password scheme which neither requires 
	plain text passwords on the net or on disk. Unfortunately this 
	is not available as Samba is stuck with being compatible with 
	other SMB systems (WinNT, WfWg, Win95 etc). </P
