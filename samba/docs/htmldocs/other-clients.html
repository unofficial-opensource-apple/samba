Alternatives - There are two free implementations of AppleTalk for
several kinds of UNIX machnes, and several more commercial ones.
These products allow you to run file services and print services
natively to Macintosh users, with no additional support required on

><P

><P
>Installing the first two together with the base operating

		has already been installed, but you now want to install the 
		networking support, use the "Selective Install for Networking" 
		object in the "System Setup" folder.</P
><P
>Adding the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver is not described 
		in the manual and just barely in the online documentation. Start 
		MPTS.EXE, click on OK, click on "Configure LAPS" and click 
		on "IBM OS/2 NETBIOS OVER TCP/IP" in  'Protocols'.  This line 
		is then moved to 'Current Configuration'. Select that line, 
		click on "Change number" and increase it from 0 to 1. Save this
		configuration.</P
><P
>If the Samba server(s) is not on your local subnet, you 
		can optionally add IP names and addresses of these servers 
		to the "Names List", or specify a  WINS server ('NetBIOS 
		Nameserver' in IBM and RFC terminology). For Warp Connect you 
		may need to download an update for 'IBM Peer' to bring it on 
		the same level as Warp 4. See the webpage mentioned above.</P

>You can have multiple drivers mapped in this file.</P

>If you only specify the OS/2 driver name, and not the

		you the driver is not available.  On the second attempt, it 
		will work.  This is fixed simply by adding the device name
  		 to the mapping, after which it will work on the first attempt.

><P
> 
There are several annoyances with Windows 2000 SP2. One of which
only appears when using a Samba server to host user profiles
to Windows 2000 SP2 clients in a Windows domain.  This assumes
that Samba is a member of the domain, but the problem will
likely occur if it is not.</P
><P
> 
In order to server profiles successfully to Windows 2000 SP2 
clients (when not operating as a PDC), Samba must have 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nt acl support = no</B
>
added to the file share which houses the roaming profiles.
If this is not done, then the Windows 2000 SP2 client will
complain about not being able to access the profile (Access 
Denied) and create multiple copies of it on disk (DOMAIN.user.001,
DOMAIN.user.002, etc...).  See the 
<A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html"
TARGET="_top"
>smb.conf(5)</A
> man page
for more details on this option.  Also note that the 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nt acl support</B
> parameter was formally a global parameter in
releases prior to Samba 2.2.2.</P
><P
> 
The following is a minimal profile share:</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	[profile]
		path = /export/profile
		create mask = 0600
		directory mask = 0700
		nt acl support = no
		read only = no</PRE
></P
><P
>The reason for this bug is that the Win2k SP2 client copies
the security descriptor for the profile which contains
the Samba server's SID, and not the domain SID.  The client
compares the SID for SAMBA\user and realizes it is
different that the one assigned to DOMAIN\user.  Hence the reason
for the "access denied" message.</P
><P
>By disabling the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>nt acl support</B
> parameter, Samba will send
the Win2k client a response to the QuerySecurityDescriptor
trans2 call which causes the client to set a default ACL
for the profile. This default ACL includes </P
